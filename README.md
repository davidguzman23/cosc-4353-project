### Design and Development Methodology
Since Assignment 1, our design and development methodologies have become more linear. We simply made goals and focused on meeting them. This change was not brought about by a deliberate decision; we just naturally assumed it. I believe this happened out of an assumption that the tasks at hand were simple.

## Front-End Technologies and Responsibilities
Our front-end was built with the React framework. The high abstraction that it provides allows us to develop sites faster. If we were making sites with pure Javascript, CSS, and HTML, we would spend much more time constantly recreating UI Elements.
