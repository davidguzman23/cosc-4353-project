Volunteer Management Web App

## Initial Thoughts 

> Consider user experience: How will users (volunteers and administrators) interact with the application?

Logining In / Registering - 
After accessing the site, both volunteers and administrators will share the same experience. They will be prompted to login via a login page to further access the site.
An option to register will be present if they do not have a login. During registration, new users will need to provide a username and password. Once these are entered,
they will be presented with an email field to verify their account.

User Profile Management -
Immediately after registering, new users will be sent to an identifier or "tag" page. This page will ask users to click on onscreen tags that identify their skills, preferences, and availability. When a user has finished, they will be prompted to enter their location as the final tag. The Tag page will be optional, a tiny skip option will be present on the page's right hand corner. Should a user choose to skip the tag
page, their events page will only favor showing urgent or prioritized events.

After they choose to skip or fill out the Tag page, all new users will be sent to the Events Page (the main page).

Event Management & Volunteer Matching -
